# Scripts-Deployment
Deploy SQL scripts in a sequence using PowerShell

Branched from https://github.com/reubensultana/Scripts-Deployment

The scriptlist.txt file is the driver to the functionality. It will basically execute the TSQL scripts (whatever is in the TSQL scripts...) to the target database server.
